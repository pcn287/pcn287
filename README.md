Hello, I'm Puchun Niu! 👋

About Me
🎓 Background: I hold a PhD in Animal Science with a focus on methane mitigation from dairy cattle. My work includes developing prediction models, exploring feed additives, and studying the rumen microbiome to tackle methane emissions.
🌱 Currently Learning: I'm currently enhancing my skills in Python programming, following several courses, and building a data integration pipeline.
💼 Working On: I’m currently working on the project Accurate Gas Emissions Measures from Cattle with the GreenFeed System. The goal of this project is to develop international standards and guidelines for estimating gas emissions from beef and dairy cattle using the GreenFeed system across a range of production scenarios. Right now, I’m focused on building the framework for an international database of gas emissions measured using the GreenFeed technique. This is based on existing studies in both dairy and beef systems, and I’m actively reaching out to collaborators to contribute experimental data.

Projects & Interests
🔍 Automated Data Management: I’m automating data management traditionally done in Excel, using Python to build a robust infrastructure for both structured and unstructured data.
🧩 Tech Stack: Python, R, and Excel, with a focus on data integration and data management for methane mitigation research.

Goals
🎯 Short-Term Goal: Build proficiency in Python programming, including data structures, custom and default functions, and processing Excel data.
🌍 Long-Term Goal: Leverage big data to design strategic approaches for methane mitigation on a global scale.

Ask Me About
🌱 Why methane mitigation in cattle is essential, how methane is measured, and effective methods to reduce emissions.
