Hello, I'm Puchun Niu! 👋

About Me
🎓 Background: I hold a PhD in Animal Science with a focus on methane mitigation from dairy cattle. My work includes developing prediction models, exploring feed additives, and studying the rumen microbiome to tackle methane emissions.
🌱 Currently Learning: I'm currently enhancing my skills in Python programming, following several courses, and building a data integration pipeline.
💼 Working On: My current projects involve integrating methane measurements from multiple sources and establishing a data management protocol using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).

Projects & Interests
🔍 Automated Data Management: I’m automating data management traditionally done in Excel, using Python to build a robust infrastructure for both structured and unstructured data.
🧩 Tech Stack: Python, R, and Excel, with a focus on data integration and data management for methane mitigation research.

Goals
🎯 Short-Term Goal: Build proficiency in Python programming, including data structures, custom and default functions, and processing Excel data.
🌍 Long-Term Goal: Leverage big data to design strategic approaches for methane mitigation on a global scale.

Ask Me About
🌱 Why methane mitigation in cattle is essential, how methane is measured, and effective methods to reduce emissions.
